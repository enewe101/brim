- we need a signalling mechanism
	- we'll use ajax, with repetitive polling -- crude but should work
	- messages will be addressed to a room #, randomly generated when the
		initiator connects.
	- a database will be used to store rooms and the signalling messages 
		associated to them
	- javascript will know the room number and whether the client is the 
		initiator based on info passed in the initial page from the server
	- javascript has the timestamp for the last message in the room, so 
		polls the server for any messages with a later timestamp (getting a
		list of them (potentially of length zero, one, or many) back.
	- let signalling.php provide helper functions for room management, as well
		as posting and putting signals

As step 1, implement the signalling channel using a database.

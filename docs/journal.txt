	I am planning to hookup peer's whiteboards this weekend.  
	I decided that, before embarking on that, I should fully convert to jQuery
	instead of prototype, before prototype gets too embedded.

	Successfully converted to jQuery.  This did break everything in the 
	process, surprisingly, one bug was introduced where scope was being lost
	on a callback, whereas it was not before.  I'm not sure how such a 
	bug was masked by prototype (there was indeed some incorrect code.).

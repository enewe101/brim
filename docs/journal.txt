	I am planning to hookup peer's whiteboards this weekend.  
	I decided that, before embarking on that, I should fully convert to jQuery
	instead of prototype, before prototype gets too embedded.

	Successfully converted to jQuery.  This did break everything in the 
	process, surprisingly, one bug was introduced where scope was being lost
	on a callback, whereas it was not before.  I'm not sure how such a 
	bug was masked by prototype (there was indeed some incorrect code.).

	Turned whiteboard into an object.  Left tool-constructors outside.  Maybe
	tools are their own objects.

	Now I need to decide how to send directives over the wire.
		var message = {
			"action" : "create",
			"path_no" : 0+,
			"strokeColor": <color>,
			"start" : <point>,
		}

	The sender of the message is assumed to be provided as a separate argument
	to the handle_message command of the whiteboard.

	At the moment, The sender Id is not actually being sent correctly.
	I intend to implement, as part of the RTC connection, tying a sender id
	to a send channel, so that every time a send channel fires it's 
	onmessage event, it provides the event, and the sender.  This means that
	the sender ID should be gotten when the channel is first opened, which
	doesn't happen right now.  For the time being, I the whiteboard doesn't
	know the sender, and simply uses the static user id 'other'.  Knowing
	the sender is important to be able to hold the curpath of different
	senders.  An alternative is to have the sender always send her id, and
	this, concatenated with her path_num would provide unique addressing of
	paths, and eleminate the need for keeping curpath state for each peer...

connection object
	- The rtc_connection object
	- provides named channels
		make_connection
			returns a connection object 
			add video send channel(constraints, callback)
			expect video receive channel(constraints, callback)
			add audio send channel(constraints, callback)
			expect audio receieve channel(constraints, callback)
			add data send channel

	- how much of building an rtc_conneciton can be carried out before 
		knowing what channels are expected?
	- can channels be added after the rtc_connection is built?
